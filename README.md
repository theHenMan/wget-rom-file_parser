# wget-rom-file_parser
### Clean ROM names generated from wget

#### Should work on most file types; but it doesn't dive into directories

##### ![This works:] (Sample_Type.png)

I used wget to get information from a site that hosted zipped ROMS.
The file generated contained a bunch of extra data.  I only want the zip name and file size.

The file wgetlog.txt is the file that was generated by wget

I created a python script to prettify the names/output
