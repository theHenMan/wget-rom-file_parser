# wget-rom-file_parser
### Clean ROM names generated from wget

#### Should work on most file types; but it doesn't dive into directories

##### This works:
![Correct:](/images/Sample_Type.PNG)

##### This doesn't:
![Incorrect:](/images/Incorrect_Format.PNG)



I used wget to get information from a site.
The file generated contained a bunch of extra data.  I only want the file name and file size.

The file generated .txt is the file that was generated by wget

I created a python script to prettify the names/output
